# Hybrid Scoring Readiness Data Contract

This artifact defines a bounded, privacy-preserving export shape for future fit recommendation analysis. It is a data contract only.

T8 does not ship ML training, model evaluation, prediction serving, shadow recommendations, report-model calculation of recommendations, or any change to the production recommendation path. The live engine remains the rule-based fit score engine, and Ollama remains a report-writing layer that consumes computed summaries only.

## Scope

The export is intended for offline analysis after enough feedback exists to compare:

- what Coordit recommended
- what size the user selected or purchased
- what fit outcome the user reported
- which body/garment parts caused issues
- which score explanation and confidence reasons the rule engine recorded
- what measurement source and parsing quality were used
- which algorithm version generated the recommendation

No database migration is required. Current fields already live in `fit_analysis_results`, `user_feedback`, `recommendation_logs`, `external_products`, `external_product_sizes`, and `fit_analysis_results.result_details`.

## Explicit Exclusions

The export must not include:

- `users.id`, `fit_analysis_results.id`, `reference_clothing_id`, `external_product_id`, `external_product_sizes.id`, or `user_feedback.id` as raw identifiers
- auth tokens, session data, emails, phone numbers, addresses, order IDs, or checkout payloads
- `user_feedback.comment`
- `user_feedback.raw_data`
- `recommendation_logs.raw_data`
- `external_products.product_url`
- `external_products.raw_product_data`
- `external_product_sizes.raw_size_data`
- `external_product_sizes.extracted_text`
- raw OCR payloads, raw parser payloads, raw product rows, or prompt-like free text

If offline analysis needs stable joins, generate `exportRef` with an environment-specific keyed hash or a run-local lookup table outside the JSONL file. Do not publish the salt/key with the export.

## Minimum Sample Caveats

This contract is not a readiness claim for model training.

- Category-level feedback personalization currently requires at least 5 usable category rows before full offsets apply.
- Part-level sensitivity currently requires at least 3 usable rows per measurement before a part multiplier applies.
- Any future ML or statistical analysis must set a higher analysis threshold per category, fit type, source quality bucket, and outcome label before drawing conclusions.
- Rows with missing outcomes, sparse measurements, unverified parser status, low extraction confidence, or conflicting feedback should remain analyzable but must not be treated as reliable labels without filtering.
- Small samples can support QA and schema validation only; they are not sufficient for model training, model selection, or production calibration.

## Read-Only Fixture Helper

`backend/src/modules/fit/fit-learning-export.ts` provides a fixture/injectable JSONL helper for contract verification only. It has no database access, network access, external ML dependency, model training path, prediction serving path, or shadow recommendation path.

The helper whitelists computed fields and omits raw/private fields even when malformed fixture rows contain comments, raw payloads, raw OCR text, private IDs, or auth tokens.

Top-level string fields are bounded before export: categories, fit types, fit labels, confidence labels, feedback labels, engagement event types, algorithm versions, measurement statuses, and size labels are retained only when they match known labels or safe short size-label syntax. Unknown, prompt-like, or private-looking strings are exported as `null` rather than carried through.
