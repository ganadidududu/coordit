# Coordit iOS Design System

## 1. Atmosphere & Identity

Coordit is a precise, calm fashion-fit tool. Its signature is deep navy chrome framing bright, lightly textured work surfaces. Gmarket Sans carries navigation, readable interface copy, and primary actions; expressive display type is reserved for non-interactive branding, selected data-display moments, and the Home `MY CLOSET` branded entry.

## 2. Color

The executable source of truth is `coordit/CoorditDesignTokens.swift` and `coordit/Main01DesignTokens.swift`.

| Role | Swift token | Value | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App surface | `CoorditDesignTokens.ColorToken.appBackground` | RGB 247, 248, 248 | Screen background |
| Chrome / ink | `CoorditDesignTokens.ColorToken.ink` | RGB 0, 12, 64 | Navigation, primary actions, key text |
| Panel | `CoorditDesignTokens.ColorToken.panel` | RGB 252, 253, 254 | Cards and title bars |
| Field | `CoorditDesignTokens.ColorToken.field` | RGB 245, 247, 252 | FitLab controls |
| Closet field | `CoorditDesignTokens.ColorToken.closetField` | RGB 242, 244, 248 | Closet controls |
| Muted text | `CoorditDesignTokens.ColorToken.muted` | RGB 126, 132, 146 | Secondary copy |
| Positive / negative | `green`, `red`, `danger` | Token-defined | Fit direction and destructive states |

New shared UI must reference these tokens. Feature-specific gradients already present in the app may retain their local stops until a separate consolidation is approved.

## 3. Typography

All text uses `CoorditTypography`; bundled PostScript names are registered by the app.

| Level | Font | Design size | Tracking | Usage |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Feature title | Gmarket Sans Bold | 22 pt | +1.5 pt | FitLab, Closet, and their child-page title bars |
| Section title | Gmarket Sans Bold | 18–20 pt | 0 | Major content sections |
| Body | Gmarket Sans Medium | 12–15 pt | 0 | Controls and explanatory copy |
| Caption | Gmarket Sans Light/Medium | 9–12 pt | 0 | Hints and metadata |
| Display | Climate Crisis KR | 17–23 pt | Screen-specific | Non-interactive branding, section labels, and selected data displays |
| Measurement | Mona12 | 10–17 pt | 0 | Numeric fashion measurements |

Text scales through SwiftUI relative text styles. Feature titles use `.headline` as their Dynamic Type reference.

## 4. Spacing & Layout

- Baseline canvas: 402 pt wide, scaled by `CoorditResponsiveMetrics`.
- Shared feature content top: 115 design pt inside `CoorditScreenScaffold`.
- Feature horizontal inset: 16 design pt.
- Feature title bar: 60 design pt tall, 29 design pt internal horizontal padding, 18 design pt icon-to-title spacing, 7 design pt corner radius.
- General spacing follows 4 pt intent where practical; image-derived legacy layouts may use measured design values through `metrics.value(_:)`.
- Bottom navigation remains owned by `CoorditScreenScaffold` and `Main01DesignTokens`.

## 5. Components

### Feature title bar

- **Structure**: full-width plain `Button` containing a leading bold `chevron.left`, the uppercase title, and a trailing spacer.
- **Variants**: title text and back action only; visual metrics are shared across FitLab and Closet.
- **Spacing**: 25 pt icon, 18 pt gap, 29 pt horizontal padding, 60 pt height, 7 pt radius.
- **States**: default and native pressed state from `Button`; no loading or disabled state.
- **Accessibility**: the entire bar is tappable and Dynamic Type is relative to `.headline`. Feature wrappers supply stable labels: FitLab uses “{title} 뒤로가기”, while Closet retains its existing visible-title label.
- **Motion**: none; navigation feedback is the destination screen change.
- **Layout**: full-width cluster within the feature's 16 pt page inset.

### Screen scaffold

- **Structure**: shared background, top chrome/header, feature content, and bottom navigation.
- **Variants**: selected tab follows `CoorditFrameRoute.selectedTab`.
- **Accessibility**: each routed screen exposes a stable `coordit-screen-*` identifier.

### Primary feature button

- **Structure**: full-width Gmarket Sans Bold label over the shared solid ink surface. Existing feature-specific height, width, and corner radius remain unchanged.
- **States**: default and native pressed state; feature flows separately define disabled/loading behavior where applicable.
- **Accessibility**: visible text supplies the label and Dynamic Type remains readable.
- **Styling**: no Climate Crisis type, gradient fill, or decorative shadow. This applies to FitLab primary actions and Closet primary actions including the total-score action.

### Home Closet branded entry

- **Structure**: left-aligned `MY CLOSET` Climate Crisis label on the original pale vertical gradient.
- **Geometry**: fixed 361 × 43 design-pt frame, 10 pt corner radius, 12 pt leading label inset, and the original restrained shadow.
- **Scope**: this is a Home feature-entry brand surface, not part of the solid primary-action button family.

### Content action buttons

- **Structure**: Gmarket Sans Bold label on either the solid ink primary surface or the solid placeholder secondary surface.
- **Geometry**: 48 pt minimum height and 7 pt corner radius. Buttons sharing one horizontal row divide the available width equally; vertically adjacent decision buttons both occupy the full content width.
- **States**: primary, secondary, pressed, and disabled. Pressed feedback uses opacity only; disabled actions remain visible at reduced opacity.
- **Accessibility**: labels may wrap to two lines, retain a 48 pt touch target, and scale relative to `.headline`.
- **Scope**: replaces content-area `.bordered` and `.borderedProminent` controls. Native alert, sheet-toolbar, keyboard-toolbar, and other system-owned controls retain platform styling.

### Global fit analysis notice

- **Structure**: top-aligned overlay banner over the current route, using the shared ink surface and `GlobalNoticeMetrics`.
- **States**: running, completed, and failed; hiding a running notice does not cancel its background analysis.
- **Interaction**: every state can be dismissed with an upward swipe or the named accessibility action. A completed report opens when tapped.
- **Lifecycle**: starting analysis shows the running notice. Completion or failure always presents a new notice even if the running notice was dismissed.
- **Motion**: an upward drag tracks the finger and dismissal exits toward the top with opacity; Reduce Motion uses opacity only.
- **Accessibility**: each state retains a stable identifier and announces that an upward swipe dismisses the notice.

### Fit report decision actions

- **Structure**: the result closes with a primary `히스토리에 추가` action, a secondary `확인하기` action, and an explicit persistence guide.
- **States**: before saving, the guide states that `확인하기` returns to FitLab without saving. After saving, the guide states that the report is available from FitLab and Home history.
- **Interaction**: saving persists the full report snapshot; confirming never writes history and returns to the FitLab input.
- **Accessibility**: both actions use stable identifiers and retain at least a 44 pt touch target.

### Home fit history preview

- **Structure**: the Home FitLab card renders at most the two most recently saved report snapshots.
- **States**: an empty state replaces sample content when no report has been saved.
- **Interaction**: selecting a preview opens that exact snapshot in the FitLab history detail screen.
- **Data**: Home and FitLab read the same app-scoped history coordinator; previews are never hard-coded samples.

## 6. Motion & Interaction

- Navigation is explicit enum state through `CoorditFrameRoute` and `onRouteChange` callbacks.
- A root feature title bar returns to Home (`.main04`); a nested feature title bar returns to its feature root unless that screen defines a closer parent.
- Motion must communicate state change and respect Reduce Motion. Do not add decorative animation to title bars.
- Interactive controls retain at least a 44 pt effective touch target.
- Adjacent content actions use matching heights and alignment; an `HStack` gives each sibling the same flexible width.

## 7. Depth & Surface

Strategy: mixed, following the existing iOS visual language.

- The app shell uses layered navy-to-surface gradients.
- Panels use the shared panel token with restrained radii.
- Feature title bars use a flat panel surface without a feature-specific shadow so all feature families align.
- Primary calls to action use the solid ink token without a decorative shadow. Gradients remain available for chrome, imagery, and non-primary feature surfaces.

## 8. Accessibility Constraints & Accepted Debt

### Constraints

- Dynamic Type must remain enabled through relative SwiftUI text styles.
- Text and icons must preserve readable contrast against panel and chrome surfaces.
- Interactive elements need stable accessibility labels/identifiers and at least 44 pt effective touch targets.
- Key navigation flows must remain operable through VoiceOver-discoverable buttons.

### Accepted Debt

None accepted for this change. Existing feature-specific token duplication outside the shared title bar is observed but not changed by this task.
